2. Locate to the correct file destination that you are wanting to download this project to
3. Clone the repository using this link:
    ```md

    ```
4. You may get prompted to input you github details, thus do so. Otherwise, the project will now be succesfully installed onto your device.

## Usage

To access this project, you can download an IDE of your choice but we recommend Visual Studio Code.

After downloading the IDE of your choice you will have access to the raw code. However to host the webpage locally, you will need to download an extension that allows you to open it into your default browser or in your IDE. I recommend Liveserver:

Then using this type of extension, right clicking the file and pressing "Open with Live Server" allows you to open the webpage in your default browser.
